# On Learning Deep Learning and Natural language processing


This is an opinionated meta-tutorial with materials directed towards learning deep learning and its application to natural language processing. My intention is to create a concise, usable and fast to go through collection meant for a programming-savvy audience.

I have tried to link, whenever possible, freely alternatives to the materials.

Comments are welcome and expected! 

* If you find an error, open a [issue](https://github.com/lmarti/learning-dl-nlp-notes/issues).
* If you think that I am missing something, create a [pull request](https://github.com/lmarti/learning-dl-nlp-notes/pulls) with the changes.


## Organization

Notes are organized in three groups. Each group has a set of prerequisites and a skill checklist that you should pass.

1. [Bootcamp](Bootcamp.md),
* Extra credit, and
* Technical setup.
