# Bootcamp

Bootcamp is meant to provide a ML/DL/NLP context as fast as possible given some basic requisites.

## Requirements

Before diving into learning it is good that you refresh your knowledge of:

* Python 3.x.: [Python Tutorial](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lmarti/machine-learning/blob/master/00.%20Python%20Tutorial.ipynb), [A collection of not-so-obvious Python stuff](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lmarti/machine-learning/blob/master/00.%20Python%20Tutorial.ipynb)
* Linear algebra: [Computational Linear Algebra for Coders](https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra)
* Probality and statistics:

## Skill checklist

* Linear regression, 
* Linear classification and logistic regression.
* Experimental methodology: train/test/validate, cross-validation.
* Performance assessment, reporting results.
* Hyperparameter optimization: grid search.
* Multilayer Perceptron (MLP): 
	* Need for more than one layer of neurons.
	* Gradient descent and error backpropagation.
	* Stochastic gradient descent.
	* Designing neural networks, choice of activation functions on each layer.
* Deep Learning:
	*  Why can't you train a *plain* MLP with many layers?: vanishing gradients.
	*  Going deep one layer at a time: stacked auto-encoders.
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
	* 	Why MLPs can't handle images.
	*  Notion of weight sharing.
	*  Convolutional layer,
	*  Pooling layer.
* 


## Libraries to master

* Numpy/scipy
* Matplotlib/seaborn
* scikit-learn
* pandas
